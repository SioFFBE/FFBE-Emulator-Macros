These macros were made to farm Chamber of Gems, but have a few drawbacks. To only enter the corresponding stage, there are several limitations, different for each chamber, read the notes before using them. No restart after a FFBE crash!

These need to be setup! Enter a stage beforehand and use the strongest/fastest AoE attack on units 1, 4 and 5. After this, you can activate the macro and it will farm crysts for you. These 3 units need to be strong enough to clear, Units 2 and 3 will only do a regular attack (which doesn't help that much). Friend unit is not used at all.
