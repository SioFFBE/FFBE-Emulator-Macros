**It will spend Lapis FAST! Make 100% sure that buying Lapis prompts a password request, so it won't go through!**

**This macro does the raid on ELT for you using repeat, but there are some things to note:**

* There is a **very small chance** that it will enter the wrong stage, meaning PRO or ADV. **This means effectively wasting 20 Lapis!** While the chance is small, make sure you're ok with that.
* Friend unit is not activated at all. So if you don't OTK, you get stuck. Account for variance in attacks.
* Unit 2+3 auto attacks, rest will repeat the last action you setup (Waylay and such).
* The artificial pauses are for safety reasons.
