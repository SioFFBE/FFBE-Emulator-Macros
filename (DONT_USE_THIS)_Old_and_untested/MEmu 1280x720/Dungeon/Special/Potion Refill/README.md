This version refills using NRG Potions. It will NOT restart after a crash but get stuck on your home screen. It will use more than one potion when refilling, how many kind of depends on your energy max. A little over half your energy bar. There are a few drawbacks with using NRG potions that remain. Almost always will enter the 2nd to last stage of a mission. Very rarely enters a weaker one. There is a tiny chance that it will enter the LAST stage of a mission, which could potentially be an Exploration. So it will get stuck in there. Also, as it uses the Back button to get out of the Item screen, there is a small chance that it will drop you back to the World screen. If possible arrange your world screen accordingly, so it won't enter anything unintended.

This will not use the friend unit but unit 2+3 for regular attack, so prepare units 1, 4 and 5 however you want it (meaning do their action).

If it crashes outside of combat, it will reset your 10 items usage inventory, so keep an eye on that.
