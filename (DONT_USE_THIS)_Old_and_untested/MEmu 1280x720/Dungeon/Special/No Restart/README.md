There is one click in the macro for unit spot 2 as a safety measure if the attacking units 1+3 both attack the same target.

Test this yourself, let it run at least one full run (best at 8x speed) on your home screen to make sure it doesn't restart FFBE (I would advise this at least every update of Nox/Memu and/or the FFBE Icon).
