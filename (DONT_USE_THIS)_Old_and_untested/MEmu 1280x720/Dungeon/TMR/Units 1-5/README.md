Intended to be used for 1/2 Energy event and Dalnakya Cavern, can be used for other missions though. Yields between 40 and 48 Rank XP each run (Dalnakya Cavern, depends on which stage is entered, mostly the easiest though). Test your team on Dalnakya Cavern - Demon's Lair first. Unit's 1-5 need to be able to clear in 1 turn. Friend unit is used ~once every 2 minutes to stop it from getting stuck with some unit combinations. You should still aim for around 200-300 ATK for each unit so that they can clear fast.
