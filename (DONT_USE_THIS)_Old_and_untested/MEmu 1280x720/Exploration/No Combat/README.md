Warning: These Explorations assume that you have no encounter other than the BOSS of the exploration. It will get stuck if you even encounter a single enemy other than the boss. 'Reduce encounter rate' stacks multiplicatively, thanks /u/tretlon
 for pointing that out. So 5x Hayate(5x 50%) + 10x Charm Bangles (10x 25%) + Diabolos (1x 25%) add up to a rate of 0.001319848 ( 0,55 * 0,7511 ). That is low, but not impossible, so use with care or keep an eye on it. It can still save you lots of time though. Getting a few Fohlen (25%) / Yun (25%) / Hayate (50%) friends and sorting for them can reduce the rate even further to 0,000989886 / 0,000989886 / 0,000659924 if those friends also have Charm Bangles and/or Diabolos, all the better. Best case (6x Hayate, 12x Charm Bangles and 2x Diabolos) would be 0,000278405. That's a lot (4,74x as good).
