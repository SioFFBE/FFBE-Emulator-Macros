The JP version will enter the mailbox if it ever crashes to the FFBE home screen. It will then try and collect mail. It may or may not actually collect mail, if there is a mail item large enough to push the button down far enough (so a bundle or something with many different items). I was unable to find someone to test this. In all other cases it will just get stuck there and maybe refresh your mail once.

NOT a spam type, so it can get stuck/fuse incorrectly if you have long load/transition times or your emulator doesn't run smoothly or you get a connection loss. For the former, you can slow it down by editing the timings. If you are unsure your configuration is up to it, do NOT leave it unattended! I made it fairly slow though, 22 seconds per fuse to be exact, so just test it a few times.

You start it at the "select unit to enhance screen" with the following filters:

Filter for enhancement selection:

Sort by level, ascending
2, 3 or 4 Star (depending on which you want to fuse)
Unit Lvl: Non-Max
Enhance


Filter for unit to fuse selection:

Sort by level, descending
2, 3 or 4 Star (depending on which you want to fuse)
Unit Lvl: Non-Max
Enhance
Craftable


It will always try to max the currently highest cactuar and start with the next after max lvl is reached. This is not the best efficiency* so if this bothers you act accordingly. Just in case: lock everything important to you.

If you run out of material to fuse (so 1 cactuar left) it will get stuck telling you, that you have selected no fuse material. If you run out of cactuar bases to fuse stuff into (so your last possible fuse brought the cactuar to max level) it will just get stuck on the selection screen.

You can run this on 2x speed if your emulator and connection are very stable. Watch it with one eye if you do.
